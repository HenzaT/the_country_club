## The Country Club - facts about countries and travel tracker
This is a self-directed project. I love travelling and learning geography facts, and so I wanted to create a space where the two come together. This is an ongoing project, and I plan to use it as an opportunity to practise some new technologies:
- TypeScript (in Rails)
- MySQL

## Goals
For this app, I wanted to:
- Consolidate my skills using Ruby on Rails, TypeScript and CSS3/SCSS. 
- Introduce and use more unfamiliar technologies, like MySQL and React.js (which I am currently learning). To facilitate using React and TypeScript in a Rails application, I switched from Webpacker to using Vite.
- Set up CI/CD

## Tech Stack
- Ruby on Rails
- Vite
- HTML5
- SCSS
- JavaScript
- TypeScript
- MySQL
- Git
- Github

## Login

## Process
I started with: 
- a rough sketch of what I wanted the app to look like. This included pictures and a description of what I wanted the user to receive from the app (a randomly generated song idea).
- the database schema.

To keep track of the features, I have been using a Trello board which is kept up to date. 


## Reflections
Before starting, I debated whether to build a project entirely with new technologies, like React.js, or to stick with familiar tools while introducing a few new ones. Drawing from the concept of the Zone of Proximal Development, which suggests people learn best when challenged just beyond their comfort zone, I chose the latter. This approach let me focus on learning technologies like MySQL without being overwhelmed, since the rest of the stack was familiar.
