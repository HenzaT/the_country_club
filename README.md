## The Country Club - facts about countries and travel tracker
This is a self-directed project. I love travelling and learning geography facts, and so I wanted to create a space where the two come together. This is an ongoing project, and I plan to use it as an opportunity to practise some new technologies:
- TypeScript (in Rails)
- MySQL

## Goals
For this app, I wanted to:
- Consolidate my skills using Ruby on Rails, TypeScript and CSS3/SCSS.
- Use third-party APIs
- Introduce and use more unfamiliar technologies, like MySQL and React.js (which I am currently learning). To facilitate using React and TypeScript in a Rails application, I switched from Webpacker to using Vite.
- Set up CI/CD

## Tech Stack
- Ruby on Rails
- Vite
- HTML5
- SCSS
- JavaScript
- TypeScript
- MySQL
- PostgreSQL
- Git
- Github

- Unsplash API
- REST Countries API


## Login
You can log in using thse details:
- username: tester@testing.com
- password: password


## Process
I started with: 
- a rough sketch of what I wanted the app to look like.
- the database schema.

Before beginning this project, I actually started building a separate frontend only country-focused app using JavaScript, TailwindCSS, the REST Countries API and HTML a few months before this. This was a good way for me to practise using the REST Countries API, as well as an opportunity to practise using TailwindCSS. Ultimately, I decided that I'd need to scale this project and would need a backend.  

To keep track of the features, I have been using a Trello board which is kept up to date. 

As I deployed my app, I realised that PostgreSQL was better suited for MySQL and switched, as I would have to install third-party solutions to be able to use MySQL in production.


## Reflections
Before starting, I debated whether to build a project entirely with new technologies, like React.js, or to stick with familiar tools while introducing a few new ones. Drawing from the concept of the Zone of Proximal Development, which suggests people learn best when challenged just beyond their comfort zone, I chose the latter. This approach let me focus on learning technologies like MySQL without being overwhelmed, since the rest of the stack was familiar.
