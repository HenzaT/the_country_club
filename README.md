## The Country Club - facts about countries and travel tracker
This is a solo project. I love travelling and learning Geography facts, and so I wanted to create a space where the two come together. This is an ongoing project.
I'm using it as an opportunity to practise TypeScript more, and so I am using Vite. I am also using MySQL, as my past projects have all used PostgreSQL.
